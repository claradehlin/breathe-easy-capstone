    <p>Hi, my name is Clara! <br> <br> I decided to make this website because I know firsthand how important it is to prioritize your mental health and take care of your brain. I made this website with the things that I have learned through research and years in therapy. <br> <br> I'm a single mom to a hungry hamster if you feel the need to support.</p>
